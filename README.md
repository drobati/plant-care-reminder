# Plant Care Reminder System

A simple API built with [Hono](https://hono.dev) and Deno 2 to manage plant care reminders. This project helps users track their plantsâ€™ watering schedules and maintenance needs.

## Features

- Add, update, and delete plant details, including watering frequency and last watered date.
- RESTful API structure for ease of integration.
- Environment support with Insomnia for streamlined API testing.

## Requirements

- **Deno**: Make sure Deno is installed. You can check with:
  ```
  deno --version
  ```
- **Deno Extension for VSCode**: For best development experience, install the Deno extension in VSCode. This helps with autocompletion, linting, and project configuration.
